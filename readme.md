## Pretraining a foundational model after SabiYarn

This repository is built, mimicking the SabiYarn, a Large Language model pre-trained on major Nigerian languages; pidgin, Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba, and English. It uses the architecture of GPT-J and is pre-trained on a larger dataset.

However, the model in this repository uses the GPT-2 architecture and is pre-trained on Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, and English datasets.
